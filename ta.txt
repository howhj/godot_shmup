GOALS

Fast paced, frantic -> exciting
Easy to grasp -> minimise frustration, easy to rank up



SCORE SYSTEM

Good:
Combo multiplier -> easy to understand, encourages speed
Hyper system -> faster kills, feels good, resource management
Proximity -> encourages them to move around and speedkill stuff
Medal chain -> adds tension, distract from speedkills

Ok:
Secrets -> also adds tension, but players may not find all of them

Bad:
Kill method bonus -> complicated, not obvious
Graze/Cancels -> discourages speed, exploitable with infinite lives
Simultaneous kills -> goes against combo system

Overall:

Kill up close -> spawn big medals -> build hyper meter quicker -> hyper to kill faster -> build chain faster + safer -> can play more aggressively

Edits:
Chain -> decay when chain gauge is empty, -20% on death
Medal -> medal chain to level up only (chain 10 to level up), medal drops don't matter, death reduces medal level



MECHANICS

[x] Focus mode/Charge shot -> used to deal with big tanky enemies, variety
Options -> can be hard to master, may feel bad
[x] Bombs -> extra player agency, can include maximum bonus?
